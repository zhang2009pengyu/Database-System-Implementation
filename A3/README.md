We implemented 4 functions in Sorting.cc:

1) sort()
performs a TPMMS of the table sortMe.

2) mergeIntoList()
accept two alternative iterators as well as a comparator, 
and then it merges the contents of the two iterators into a list of anonymous pages.

3) mergeIntoFile()
accepts a list of alliterative iterators, 
and then merges the contents of all of those iterators into a single file.

4) appendHelper()
helper function that appends a record to a page vector.


We have tested our code on clear and successfully passed all the 4 test cases!
